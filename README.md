Ever wondered what you would look like if you were somehow teleported into Teyvat like the Traveller? With Genshinfy, you can now see which Genshin Impact character you most closely resemble and turn yourself into one of them!  
 
Genshinfy uses a Siamese Network to match your headshot to the most similar Genshin Impact character from the character dataset using cosine similarity, and a VGG19 model applies neural style transfer to turn you into your own Genshin Impact avatar.

All Genshin Impact characters can be found in the `GenshinCharacters` folder.

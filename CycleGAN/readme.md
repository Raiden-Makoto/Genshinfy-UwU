# CycleGAN
This model is uses the CycleGAN model to generate anime avatars of human faces to create image pairs for training the **Siamese Network** model that is used to compute the cosine similarity between faces. This model was trained on the [CelebA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset) Dataset and the [Anime Face](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset) Dataset. The generated images can be found in the `SiameseData` folder.
